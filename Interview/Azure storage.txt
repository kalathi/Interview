BLOB (Binary Large Object)

* collectiong of binary data stored as single entity in a storage systen.
  blobs are typically images, audio, or other multiledia objects or binary executable codes 
* it supports unstraucture data 

Storage Types

1 Blob storgae ( unstructured data esigned for frond end )
	* Block blob limited to less no of read/write request
	* page blob  more no of read/write request (ideal for VHD images
2 Table storage ( structured data )
3 queue storage ( Message data )
4 File storage ( SMB file shares

storage account Types

standard azure account 
premium Azure account ( Solid state device  for good performance )
	* ssd upto 4TB per VM
	* 80000IOPs 

Locally redundant storage 
	* 3 copies within single data center
Zone redundant storage 
	* 3 copies across 2-3 data =centers
	* Block blob only;available only during SA creation
Geo-redundant storage 
	* 3 copies in primary region
	* 3 copies in secondary region
Read access Geo redundant storage 
	* Read only access to secondary region data

Azure File level sharing

* SMB - server message block
 	* works on layer 7 for file sharing protocol developed by microsoft
	* TCP on port 445
	* tcp/udp on port 137-139
	* common interface file system 

* Endpoint must be https://account.file.core.windows.net/share/direct/file
* share can be mounted using net use command

Mount sharing in Ubuntu maching

* install the CIFS utils package ( #apt-get install cifs-utils )
* mount -t cifs //storacct.file.core.windows.net/share ./mountpoint -o vers=.0,username=acct,password=mykey,dir_mode=077,file_mode=0777
 

net use K: \\electronicfare.file.core.windows.net\electirctools  /u:AZURE\electronicfare hGT5SEUPA8mgVvF2JOgCssx+3auqi7fA7z25AjwhlWmAOXiPE8XIIetdlJBbmE+Uw9xDE/88Aw/OvHzYzkzaKg==

Linux machine

sudo mount -t cifs //electronicfare.file.core.windows.net/electirctools /kalathi -o vers=3.0,username=electronicfare,password=hGT5SEUPA8mgVvF2JOgCssx+3auqi7fA7z25AjwhlWmAOXiPE8XIIetdlJBbmE+Uw9xDE/88Aw/OvHzYzkzaKg==,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,sec=ntlmssp

CDN - content delivery network or content distribution network
* globally distributed server aross the world and serve the contents to end user with high availability and high performance
* create CDN profile and link with storage account
* replication takes 90 mintues to all the edge location of azure network.it will return 404 when you access the URL before 90 minutes

Azure Import/Export Service

import - Transfer hard drives to microsoft. they l populate your blob storage
export  - copy our bob data to hard drives. that can be imported in our on-premises data center or other cloud providers like ams google etc

Azure storage permissions model

Server administrator	-   Can manage all the storage accounts
ARM RBAC	-	Storage account contributor role
Storage keyholder	-	Mnage single storage account
Shared access signature 	-	Granular policy driven control

Reason for primary and secondary keys
* keep primary, share secondary
* revoke access by regenerating secondary key
* Periodic key rollover

Container Permission

* Private	- No anonymous access	
* Blob	-  anonymous access to blobs (no enumeration )
* container - anonymous access to container (listing blobs )

Listing container 
https://kalathi89.blob.core.windows.net/graph

https://kalathi89.blob.core.windows.net/?comp=list

shared access signature- provides temporary access to the indidual container or blobs/tables/queus inside the containers
this can be provided with temp URI and that is valid only for the time period can be controlled by stored access policy.

only 5 access polices can be associated with cotainer or table or queueu
