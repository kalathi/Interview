Types of Azure admin accounts

Account Administrator (AA) 	
1 per Azure account 	
This is the person who signed up for or bought Azure subscriptions, and is authorized to access the Account Center and perform various management tasks. 
These include being able to create subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change the billing for a subscription, and change the Service Administrator.

Service Administrator (SA) 	
1 per Azure subscription 	
This role is authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. 
By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator.

Co-administrator (CA) in the Azure classic portal 	
200 per subscription 	This role has the same access privileges as the Service Administrator, 
but can’t change the association of subscriptions to Azure directories.


When you have an app or script that needs to access resources, you can set up an identity for the app and authenticate the app with its own credentials.
 his identity is known as a service principal. This approach enables you to:

=> Assign permissions to the app identity that are different than your own permissions. Typically, these permissions are restricted to exactly what the app needs to do.
=> Use a certificate for authentication when executing an unattended script
