If I reduce my scale set capacity from 20 to 15, which VMs are removed?+

A. Virtual machines are removed from the scale set evenly across update domains and fault domains to maximize availability.
 VMs with the highest IDs are removed first.

What if I then increase the capacity from 15 to 18?
A. If you increase capacity to 18, then 3 new VMs are created. Each time, the VM instance ID is incremented from the previous highest value (for example, 20, 21, 22).
 VMs are balanced across fault domains and update domains
